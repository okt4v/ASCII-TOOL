## Future Updates

In the future I am planning on adding a couple of new things and improving some already existing things:
   
   1. Improve overall code logic for better performance
   2. Improve terminal user interface (colors, layout, ...)
   3. Improve error handling
   4. Add command line arguments for quick and easy access to the tool without the terminal user interface
